# Prosper.com Loans: Exploring Relationships Affecting the Borrower's Interest Rate
## by Richard Steele



## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans from the peer-to-peer lending pioneer Prosper Marketplace. The features include
each loan borrower's stated interest rate, the range of credit scores, the debt-to-income ratio, the borrower's number of open credit lines, among other characteristics. 


## Summary of Findings

My exploration of the data revealed a strong relationship between the borrower's interest rate and the numeric version of the company's own "Prosper Rating," with secondary influences from the borrower's credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. The relationship between the interest rate and the Prosper rating was nearly linear on a line plot, as was that between the Prosper rating and the income measurements. I also found that the correlations between the interest rate and the majority of chosen variables were surprisingly weak; the same variables also had very weak correlations with the Prosper rating.  


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I emphasize the influence of the Prosper rating, income, 
and debt-to-income ratio, omitting the lesser-influence variables. I start by introducing the
boirrower-interest variable, followed by the pattern in carat distribution, then plot the
transformed scatterplot.
